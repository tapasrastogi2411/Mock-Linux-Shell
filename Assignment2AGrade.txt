==== A2 phase I marking ====

Group number: group_0476
UTORID usernames of members: kharolba, amirrazi, doshish2, rastog32
Total deductions: 5
Grade: B- (72%)

Your team's Phase II grade is based on this scale:

    https://transcripts.utoronto.ca/faqs/grade-scale/
When converting from letter grade to numerical grade, we will use the higher end of the letter grade to convert your mark.
--For example, the higher end of A+ is 100.
--For example, the higher end of A is 89.
.
.
.
In the event that you get a F, your conversion from letter grade to numerical grade will be based on the discretion of the instructor. 

The way we graded is as follows: your team starts with an A+. When errors and
problems are found, you will lose 0, 1, 2, or 3 letter steps, depending on the
severity. As an example, if you lost two steps, your team would earn an A-:

     A+ -> A
     A -> A-

You were asked to follow the Scrum process. A big part of that is to maintain
a product backlog and a sprint backlog.
