What did I work on in the last three days?
    - started the coding for JShell, PromptUserInput, EchoAppend, EchoOverwrite, PrintDocumentation, ChangeDirectory

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Complete the code that I am responsible for which are the 6 classes mentioned above

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Some of the code can be quite challenging but I will try my best and seek help from team members if I'm particularly stuck
