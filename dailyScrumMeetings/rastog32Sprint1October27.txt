a) What did I work on in the last three days? 

    - brainstormed ideas with the other group members on how we all should tackle working on the coding part of the assignment

    - Add CRC Cards for PushDirectory and PopDirectory Commands as per the design which was discussed by the group

    - Review and update(if necessary) the ConcatenateCommand, File, Directory, FileSystem Commands classes which was already implemented and designed as part of A1, incorporate any new changes that might be needed due to the different client requirements

    - Finalise the design of the program by covering any changes which we feel might need to incorporate

   b) What do I plan to work in the next three days? 

   - Have a good and complete understanding of what needs to be done for the coding part of the assignment 

   - Complete the coding part for MakeDirectory, Files, Directory, FileSystem, and Commands classes

  
    c) Am I blocked on anything? 

    - Still not very sure on how the coding part of Assignment 2 needs to be implemented, will go to OH to get it cleared and start working on it as soon as possible
