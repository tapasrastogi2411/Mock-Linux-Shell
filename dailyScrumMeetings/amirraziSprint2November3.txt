What did I work on in the last three days?
    - continued the coding for EchoAppend, EchoOverwrite, PrintDocumentation, ChangeDirectory
    - Finished coding for PromptUserInput and JShell
    - helped with some coding in the Commands class

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Complete the code that I am responsible for PrintDocumentation and ChangeDirectory
    - Complete my section of the coding for the Commands class that has recently been designated to me

Am I blocked on anything?
    - ChangeDirectory prove to be challenging so I will be asking for Shashwat's help with it.
