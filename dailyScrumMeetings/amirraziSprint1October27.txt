What did I work on in the last three days?
    - finalized on the design of the program with my team members
    - completed the CRC cards that I was responsible for
    - started on the coding aspect of ChangeDirectory

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Start and complete the coding on EchoOverwrite, EchoAppend, PrintDocumentation, and ChangeDirectory
    - Start the coding on Shell and PromptUserInput

Am I blocked on anything?
    - I have not completed the code for ChangeDirectory as it inherits from the Commands class which our team has not completed yet
