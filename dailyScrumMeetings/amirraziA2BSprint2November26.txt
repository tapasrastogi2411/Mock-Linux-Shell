What did I work on in the last three days?
    - fixed echo and other commands that needed redirection
    - helped team member optimize the tree command so that it is more generalized and can  	help in the development of save and load

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - complete saveJShell and loadJShell
    - start testing for classes from 2A

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need to look out for minor bugs and edge cases
