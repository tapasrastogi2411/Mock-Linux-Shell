a) What did I work on in the last three days? 

   - Brainstormed more ideas on how to go about the coding part for MakeDirectory class after going to Office hours

   - Made a few changes in the FileSystem of our mock shell to supplement the coding part of Makedirectory and ChangeDirectory classes

   - Collaborated with my teammates to accomodate their command requirements in my commands 


b) What do I plan to work in the next three days? 

   - Complete the coding part for MakeDirectory class and run sufficient tests to ensure that it actually creates directories as required

   - Testing the Concatenate Command that was implemented by my teammates to ensure that it does what is required of it

   - Edit FileSystem class ( if needed) to accomodate the other commands my teammates are working on and also do testing to ensure that a proper FileSystem structure is created by the program 

   - Testing the PathParser Command implemented by me teammates

   - Testing to see if the overall program runs smoothly 

  
c) Am I blocked on anything? 

   - The MakeDirectory Command coding implementation. Still not sure how to go about implementing it correctly

    - Blocked on how to go about implementing the MakeDirectory class
