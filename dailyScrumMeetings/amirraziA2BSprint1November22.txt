What did I work on in the last three days?
    - started working on saveJShell and loadJShell

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - complete saveJShell and loadJShell
    - start working on the redirection feature for the commands that produce STDOUT
    - start testing for classes from 2A

Am I blocked on anything?
    - how to save and load the JShell, need to go review lecture material to find out
    - need to review how to do JUnit test as well
