   - Helped my teammates with implementing of some of their coding parts


b) What do I plan to work in the next three days? 

   - Complete the coding part for MakeDirectory class and run sufficient tests to ensure that it actually creates directories as required

   - Testing the Concatenate Command that was implemented by my teammates to ensure that it does what is required of it

   - Edit FileSystem class ( if needed) to accomodate the other commands my teammates are working on and also do testing to ensure that a proper FileSystem structure is created by the program 

   - Testing the PathParser Command implemented by me teammates

   - Testing to see if the overall program runs smoothly 

  
c) Am I blocked on anything? 

   - The MakeDirectory Command coding implementation. Still not sure how to go about implementing it correctly
