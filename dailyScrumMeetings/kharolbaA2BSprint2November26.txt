What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Conducted error checking for some of the classes I recently worked on.
    - Worked on redirection for commands that produce STDOUT
    - Worked on Copy and move

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Finish copy and move implementation.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Figure out how to differentiate between file and directory path.
