//Sprint 1 Backlog
October 21st to October 27th

User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user, I want to quit the program, so that it does not run in the background.
b) As a user, I want to create two directories that may be relative to the current directory or may
   be a full path, so that I can store contents inside the directories I have just created.
c) As a user, I want to change directory which may be relative to the current directory or may be a
   full path, so I can access any desired directories.
d) As a user, I want details of all the files and folders of the current directory I am in or a
   directory given as a full or relative path, so that I can see the list of files and folders
   within the appropriate directory
e) As a user, I want to see the whole path of the current working directory, so that I know the
   exact path of the directory I am in.
f) As a user, I want to save the current working directory, so that my current working directory
   gets updated to the new directory and I can access it later if I want.
g) As a user, I want to access the latest saved directory, so that I can get my current working
   directory to become that directory.
h) As a user, I want to see the recent commands that I have used in the terminal session, so that I
   know the previously used commands and I can reuse them accordingly.
i) As a user, I want to see the contents of the files that I have chosen, so that I know that
   contents of any file.
j) As a user, I want to overwrite a file with line(s) of text, so that I can update the file with
   new content, overwriting all pre-existing content of file.
k) As a user, I want to add new line(s) of text into a file, so that I have new content added along
   with the pre-existing content of the file. (add content to a file)
l) As a programmer, I want to see the documentation for the command(s), so that I can learn more
   about each command(s).
m) As a user, I want to maintain the files and directories together in the mock filesystem, so that I can navigate  
   through the contents of the file system
n) As a user, I want the shell to continually prompt me for input, so that I can have continuous access to a command  
   line interpreter
o) As a user, I want to identify if the path passed as an argument to a command is passed relatively or absolutely, so 
   that I can account for the directories in context of the commands that maybe relative to thecurrent directory or maybe a full path
p) As a user, I want an interface that allows  me to access all the commands, so that I can execute required
   commands to complete my tasks
q) As a user, I want an appropriate errormessage displayed in the shell when I have passed an invalid commmand/path, so
   that I am aware that I have made said error in passing the command/path, enabling me tohereby pass a valid command/path
