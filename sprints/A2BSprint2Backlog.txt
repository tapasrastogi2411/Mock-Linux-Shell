//Sprint 2 Backlog
November 23rd to November 30th

User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user, I want to remove a directory so that the directory does not exist in the file system anymore.
b) As a user, I want to create new directories that may be relative to the current directory 
   or may be a full path, so that I can store contents inside the directories I have just created.
c) As a user, I want to see the contents of the directory of my choice as well as the 
   contents of its subdirectories if I choose to, so that I can know the contents of a directory.
d) As a user, I want to move directories/files based on the path that I have provided, 
   so that the directories/files is located in a new location in the file system. 
e) As a user, I want to copy directories/files of my choice, 
   so that I can have two copies of the same directories/files in the file system.
f) As a user, I want to see the contents of the files that I have chosen, so that I know that contents of any file.
g) As a user, I want to add a file from a URL that I have given to the directory that I am in 
   so that I have a copy of an external file in my internal system.
h) As a user, I want to print the text that I have entered so that I can see the text in the system.
i) As a programmer, I want to see the documentation for the command, so that I can learn more about each command.
j) As a user, I want to save the JShell so that my files will be saved even after I turn off my computer.
k) As a user, I want to load the JShell so that I can interact with the file system and its contents to perform other tasks.
l) As a user, I want to search for directories or files in the file system 
   so that I can know whether the directory or file I am looking for exists.
m) As a user, I want to see the structure of the file system 
   so that I know where all my directories and files are located within the file system.
n) As a user, I want to see the recent commands that I have used in the terminal session, 
   so that I know the previously used commands and I can reuse them accordingly.
o) As a user, I want to see the whole path of the current working directory, 
   so that I know the exact path of the directory I am in.
